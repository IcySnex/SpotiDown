![Previw](https://github.com/IcySnex/SpotiDown/raw/main/other/preview.png)
SpotiDown is an app that is designed to download music from Spotify & YouTube directly to the local drive.

## How does it work?
SpotiDown uses the Spotify Web API/YouTube API to get all track Infos (Title, Artist, Artwork etc...). Then the app searches for the tracks on YouTube and downloads them with all meta data including fetched lyrics from genius.com.

## Usage Notices
SpotiDown doesnt show any ads, supports Albums, Playlist, Tracks and is completely free to use.
Please note that downloading copyright songs may be illegal in your country. SpotiDown is not responsible for any damages, this is for educational purposes only!
